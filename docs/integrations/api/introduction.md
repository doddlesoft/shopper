# Introduction to our API

Hi there, welcome to the Shopper API which lets you control everything in your Shopper account through a simple, structured Application Programming Interface (API).

Everything you see in your account can be controlled by the API, and as a bonus, all changes you make with the API will be visible in realtime in your account.

![Account](../../../assets/images/account.png "Your Account")

Let's help get you started:

1. Learn about our API [authentication](./authentication.md "Authentication") and generate your first API key.
2. Retrieve one of your [Lists](./lists.md "Lists") including it's [Items](./items.md "Items").
3. Keep your Items organised using [Meals](./meals.md "Meals") to make life a doddle!
